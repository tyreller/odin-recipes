        Pasta Fagioli is a classic Italian-American comfort food. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.

        <li> ¼ cup tomato paste </li>
        <li> 3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 3 cups chopped Swiss chard </li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained </li>
        <li> ¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional for serving, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather the ingredients. </li>
        <li> 
            Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. 
            Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. 
            Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.         
        </li>
        <li> 
            Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. 
            Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. 
            Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. 
            Add more broth if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chopped chard in a bowl.
            Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl.
            Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup.
            Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
            Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese.
            Serve topped with additional grated cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>

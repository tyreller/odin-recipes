        I first had this pesto grilled cheese sandwich at a small restaurant and 
        immediately went home to duplicate the recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way <ever since!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon softened butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Italian bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared pesto sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 slice provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 slices tomato</li>
        <li>1 slice American cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread butter on one side of a slice of bread and place it, buttered side down, into a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the pesto sauce on the unbuttered side of the bread. Stack provolone cheese, tomato, and American cheese on top of pesto, in that order.</li>
        <li>Spread remaining pesto sauce on second slice of bread. Place it pesto side down onto sandwich in the pan. Butter the top side of bread.</li>
        <li>Gently fry sandwich, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>

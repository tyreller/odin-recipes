# odin-recipes
Web Page Project for the odin project
## Objective
In this project I will build a webpage that displays recipes

## Skills required
For this project I will need to link a home page to many recipes, each page containing the corresponding recipe
The home page will have a unordered list of all the recipes
Images can also be added, displaying some/all recipes for better understanding


## Skills learned
I successfully learned:
- To connect pages together with main index
- To connect pages to other webpages
- Connect pages opening new tab or in the same tab
- Use strong tag to denote important information and em tag to denote "interesting"/relevant parts
- Show images from other webpages with alt text
- Display information with ordered and unordered lists
- Display basic paragraphs

## Future Improvements
I would really like some be able to make the page more "flashy", so:
- Add animations, such as fade ins for images
- Improve the interface to make it more responsive
- Add captions below images to explain briefly what they are
- Minor improvements such as add more recipes, or make the text more "interesting" are also considered
